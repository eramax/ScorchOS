CHANGES...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
October 31st 2012 - ScorchOS 0.1.5
- Fixed the timer driver that somehow dissapeared from the SVN Repo version [SRC/TIMER.C]
- Made the Comments better, Everything is labled save the klude of a shell
- Reorderd a few things in various files
- No new features yet, just house cleaning

December 20th 2010 - ScorchOS 0.1
- ANSI STANDARD STRING SUPPORT [SRC/STRING.C, INCLUDES/STRING.H]
Provides ANSI Standard libc string support throughout the kernel. This was only partially implemented
with previous kernel versions

- UPDATED KEYBOARD DRIVER [SRC/KB.C, INCLUDES/KB.H]
Now supports special keys such as cmd, alt, shift, caps lock and nums lock. Also supports lighting
up the relevant LEDs on the keyboard when caps lock and nums lock are activated/deactivated.
Also a number of ANSI standard C get_char functions provided, and most moved to a dedicated
header file.

- NEW SHELL [SRC/SHELL.C]
Dropped vterm.c in favour of an updated shell that makes use of all the new libc and keyboard
elements. The backspace and atoi bugs that plagued 0.0.7 has also been fixed. Addition of
exponent function and a new string parsing algorithm. Also supports user logins.

- UPDATED BUILD SCRIPTS [BUILD.BAT, LINBUILD.SH, SRC/INCLUDES/MBOOT.H, SRC/MAIN.C, SRC/START.S]
Both now work without requiring a cross-compiler by specifying the relevant architecture at
compile and link stages of the kernel build. Linux build script no longer requires root
permissions to run (prompts when needed).
ScorchOS is now generated as an ELF binary rather than a plain binary. This makes things easier
while using a GCC cross-compiler and gives us the potential to access MBOOT information
from grub in future versions of the kernel.

- USE OF MAKEFILES FOR BUILDS [MAKEFILE, LINBUILD.SH]
No longer requires build scripts to contain definitions for particular cross compilers, and
works across both build platforms.

- UPDATED SCRIPTS/DOCUMENTATION
Cleaned up a number of unneeded scripts and folders from the source distribution, and also cleared
up redundant license documents.


- BOCHS SUPPORT ON WINDOWS AND LINUX [BOCHSRC.TXT, BOCHSOUT.TXT, LINBOCHS.SH]
There is now rudimentary support for the BOCHS emulator on Windows and Linux operating systems.


March 17th 2009 - ScorchOS 0.0.7 Patch 1
- NUMEROUS SHELL BUG-FIXES [SRC/SHELL.C, SRC/VTERM.C, SRC/KB.C, SRC/INCLUDE/SYSTEM.H, SRC/SCRN.C)
These include:
   * add/take commands handling input more gracefully
   * rewritten atoi() function
   * backspace bug partially fixed (now allows removal of many characters and replacement of one)
   * blinking cursor bug partially fixed (now arrives on the correct line for command input)

- REMOVAL OF DEBUGGING MEASURES [ALL FILES]
These should have been removed for the original ScorchOS 0.0.7 release but for reasons completely
beyond me, they weren't! They have either been removed entirely or commented out


March 7th 2009 - ScorchOS 0.0.7
- NEW LICENSE [ALL FILES]
Unlike ApolloOS, ScorchOS is licensed under the Apache License v2. A copy of the license is available
in DOC/LICENSE-2.0.TXT, how it applies to this project is informally explained in DOC/LICENSENOTES.TXT
and all attribution information is contain within DOC/NOTICE.TXT

- SOME COMMANDS ADDED [SHELL.C]


A full list of all commands is included and can be accessed with "ahelp". 
Add and print do not work but the short manuals have been included, soon as well for the others.



- CONSOLE/SHELL INPUT SUPPORT [SRC/INCLUDE/COMMANDS.INC, SRC/VTERM.C, SRC/SHELL.C, SRC/KB.C, SRC/INCLUDE/SYSTEM.H]
as you can see this has been the main focus of this release. Users can now input commands using the keyboard, then
watch as pressing enter will then run a command (or tell them it doesn't exist, if that's the case).

- SHORTER COUNTDOWN [SRC/TIMER.C]
now counts for 5 seconds at start-up instead of 10, and also outputs 'Countdown Complete!' when finished rather
 than suggest an infinite loop!

- NEW CHANGE LOG [DOC/CHANGES.TXT]
introduction of this file to help developers know differences between releases and work done


- ALTERED TOP-OF-PAGE LICENSE NOTICE [ALL AFFECTED FILES]
Removal of 'based on MikeOS 1.4.2 and bkerndev' as this has misled people with the previous release.
 These two projects will now be acknowledged in DOC/NOTICE.TXT


- MOVE CREDITS.TXT to DOC Directory & Updated[DOC/NOTICE.TXT]
To keep continuity of documentation and to acknowledge various people/projects

- UPDATE README.TXT [README.TXT]
Removed incorrect information, updated shell script addresses and added how to use shell scripts to mount/unmount 
the floppy image to take a look.


- CORRECTED ALL VERSION BRANDING [ALL FILES]
They should all now refer to 'ScorchOS 0.0.7' rather than 'ApolloOS 0.1'

- NEW SOURCE MAP [DOC/SOURCEMAP.TXT]
This file is a quick guide to where everything is and what it does
